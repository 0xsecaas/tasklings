# Tasklings

## Why Tasklings?

Tasklings was built for tracking long-term goals.  
I had a plan with 150 small actionable steps. I needed a way to tackle one task at a time, track progress and stay motivated.  

Tasklings helps break a big dream into steps, keep them in a clean and minimal interface, and move forward with focus.

It is built to answer a simple daily question:  
> "What should I do today to make 1% progress?"

With Tasklings, your day to day task is simple: follow and execute.
